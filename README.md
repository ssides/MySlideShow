# MySlideShow
Windows 11 only has a slideshow feature that is connected to Personalization settings, which is inconvenient.  Photos has a slideshow feature but it's hard to control what is actually in the slideshow.

This windows forms application reads all the images from a configured folder, sorts them by name and displays them.  You have a N)ext and P)revious button.  Simple.
